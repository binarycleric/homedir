# Welcome to HomeDir

Do you have a home directory? Want to keep it sane, safe, and easy to use on multiple systems?

Then you want HomeDir!

## The Story So Farâ€¦

Since about 1999 I've been keeping my home directory config files in
[CVS](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/). As the number of config files I've
been storing has grown and as the number of different systems I use it
on (my work desktop, my home desktop, my laptop, Gerf, my pda)
increases. As the complexity has grown it has become harder to
maintain.

So, I started looking around for a better solution. I noticed that
[SVN](http://subversion.tigris.org/) is a much better version control
system. I was already familiar with
[stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html) as well. So I
tinkered around with combining them.

And thus homedir was born!

Since then, I rewrote HomeDir completely in python. This gives me more
control over the help and error messages. I can do better when
conflicts arrive. As well as I can add an elementry package format,
which allows me to solve the problem that uninstalling a stow package
can take forever if you have a lot of directories in your home.

A [friend](http://willnorris.com/) pointed out that the most important
part was the package manager.  The various .dotfiles are interesting
to look at, but most people have their own.  So I moved just the
package manager portion to [github](http://github.com/)

## Requirements

You must have python 2.5 or newer.

## Quick Install

This is being worked on.  A new version will be done soon.

also done something similar and written two articles about it:
